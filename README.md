# Draw with KNNs!

A Node app which allows the user to draw on a canvas with assistance by a KNN algorithm. 
The KNN algorithm has the following controls 

<ul>
<li> K : indicates the number of closest neighbours to take into account;
<li> Num Points : indicates the number of random points used to train the algorithm;
</ul>

On the visual side, the Style and Extra parameters are self-explenatory and fun to play with.
